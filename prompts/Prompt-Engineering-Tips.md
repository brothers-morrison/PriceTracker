		- ask me 3 questions to clarify my intent, ask them one at a time then combine what you've learned and try again

	## Refinement Pattern:
		- Before answering, propose two sharper versions of my question and ask which one I prefer.

# Steer me to Experts
-----------------------------------

	Direct the model away from the middle, 
	Mention the Experts/Frameworks/excellence
	
	1) Ask who the experts are first
	2) List the top Experts/Researches/and current thinking on {{topic}}
		Synthesize the current research


# 6: Verify the results
-----------------------------------
*Stop making stuff up*

Critique & Verify
	- Assumptions
		- List every assumption you made and rank them each by confidence
	- Sources
		- Cite 2 independent sources for each major claim that you just made,
		Include title, URL, and a oneline quote.
	- Counter evidence
		- Find one credible source that disagrees with your answer, 
		explain the dependencies and differences from your answer.
	- Auditing
		- Recompute every figure.  Show your math and code.
	- Cross Model verification
		- Run the same prompt in ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini
		- Feed the claims from one into the other(s) and ask them to verify it.
		
		
# 7: Style
------------------------------------
*Treat AI like your sparring partner*
## OCEAN
	- O : Original : 
		Is there a non-obvious idea?
		Give me three angles no one else has thought about: 
		label one as "risky" and recommend the one that you like the most.
	- C : Concrete : Back every claim with one real example.
		Are these names, examples, and numbers that make sense? 
		IF not, ask; back every claim with one real example.
	- E : Evident
		Is the reasoning visible?  Is there enough evidence?
		If not, show your logic in three bullets, 
		show evidence before you provide final answer
	- A : Assertive
		Does your answer take a stance that you can agree or disagree with?
		Pick a side, state your thesis. Defend it, and then address the best counterpoint.
	- N : Narrative
		What's the Story. Does it flow?
		Hook/Problem/Inside Proof/Write it like a story
